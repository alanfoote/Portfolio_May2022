        <h1>Welcome to my Website Portfolio.</h1>
        <p>Much has happened since this website was created. I have moved further along in my graduate studies with the assistance of Prof. Jim Thatcher and Prof. Ema Slager at the University of Washington - Tacoma, while also learning new data analysis skill as an intern with the <a href="https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/community-partnerships"><strong>Office of Community Partnerships</strong></a>. Over the past few months I have had experience with the principals and theory of mobile web application development, community economic data analysis and presentation using SPSS and Power BI, as well as advanced Python scripting application using Anaconda in both areas of learning (academic and professional).  </p><p> I have also formalized my research proposal for my capstone, where I will explore the spatial distribution of low-income housing around light rail stations within the city of Seattle. My goal is determine what is causing uneven development to occur and what tools are being used to implement existing sustainable development around these transit stops. For this project I will interview community developers behind some of the more sustainable projects that have been created, and conduct a spatial analysis of the existing and planned locations of low-income housing around transit hubs to determine socio-economic factors that may be influencing the current geographic mismatch of affordable housing distribution. You can read my proposal in the <b><a href="work.html">Work</a></b> section. </p>
