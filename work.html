Aligning Census data with the stressful attributes most often present in the act of eviction, this project was built to be used by outreach communities in Winter of 2021. Inspired by the pressure built up by the eviction moratoriums in place due to COVID-19, my hope was to create a study of value to those most in need of retaining their housing in Tacoma.  </strong></h3>

                    <h3><strong>In 2009, Seattle began operation of the voter approved Sound Transit Light Rail, which connected the downtown to the airport through the cities most underserved communities. The project was sold to the public as an economic generator that would create good jobs and attract global investment. Due to the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis it took a while for that development to occur, but as the third phase of the light rail expansion moves forward we can see that only some communities are receiving the investment while others are being left behind. In terms of housing, the recently opened Roosevelt Station had 1,323 units of new housing built around it, while the Rainer Beach and Mt. Baker Stations have only created 313 new housing units since their openings 12 years ago. This study looks at the legacy of uneven development around transit stations amidst high demand for housing, and why some communities are acquiring larger concentrations of transit-oriented development while others are still left with none. By reviewing the history of new construction permits within Â½ mile of light rail stations, this project uses GIS and multi-variate logistical regression models to attempt to visualize the racialized segregation of property and marginalized dispossession of investment. This project also produces an interactive web-based application that will apply the determining variables for investment to make a predictive analysis at future light rail stations. </strong></h3>
